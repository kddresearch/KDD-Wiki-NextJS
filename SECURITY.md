# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our repository very seriously. If you discover a
vulnerability within our repository, we encourage you to report it 
responsibly. Please send your findings directly to the main wiki 
maintainer via email to ensure confidentiality.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

Follow the instructions under the [Security tab](https://github.com/kddresearch/KDD-Wiki-NextJS/security) 
of the Github Repo, and press "Report a vulnerability." This will 
privately notify the maintainers of the wiki to ensure that the proper 
security precautions are taken place

### Recognition

While we operate on a grant-to-grant basis and cannot guarantee rewards,
we acknowledge the importance of your contributions. We may offer an 
award depending on the severity of the reported vulnerability as a token
of our appreciation for your efforts in improving our security.

Thank you for helping us keep our community and the KSU KDD Research Lab
safe.
